### 4.16 题目
* Carry out a true three-body simulation in which the motions Of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are all calculated. Since all three bodies are now in motion ， it is useful to take the center Of mass Of t he three-body system the origin, rather than the position Of Sun. We also suggest that you give Sun an initial velocity which makes the total momentum Of the system exactly zero （So that the center of mass will remain fixed） ，study the motion Of Earth with different initial conditions. Also, try increasing the mass Of Jupiter to 10 ， 100 ， and 1000 times its true mass.
