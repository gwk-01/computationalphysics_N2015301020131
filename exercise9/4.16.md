### 4.16 题目
* Carry out a true three-body simulation in which the motions Of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are all calculated. Since all three bodies are now in motion ， it is useful to take the center Of mass Of t he three-body system the origin, rather than the position Of Sun. We also suggest that you give Sun an initial velocity which makes the total momentum Of the system exactly zero （So that the center of mass will remain fixed） ，study the motion Of Earth with different initial conditions. Also, try increasing the mass Of Jupiter to 10 ， 100 ， and 1000 times its true mass.

### 解答
* 木星，太阳，地球三者均满足万有引力定律

* 假设三者最初在一条直线上，由各常数可绘出轨道图 [代码](./)

* 太阳轨迹放大



* 质量放大十倍后，轨道变为



* 质量放大100倍后，轨道变为



* 质量放大1000倍后，轨道变为

* 地球轨迹
